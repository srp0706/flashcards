# flashcards
A small project to help me in learning vocabulary in foreign languages (I'm using this to learn mandarin).
   
**Requirements:**
- Python >= 3.8 (not checked, might run with whatever Python>3);
- Flask >= 1.1.2;
   
**To run:** in the parent directory type `run_flashcards`, then open the browser on [http://localhost:5000](http:/localhost:5000).
   
   
**To-do list:**
- Add an update/delete function to manage cards;
- Add some kind of session statistics to see how many correct guesses in a row;
- Tweak the allcards layout to center the cards in the available space.
